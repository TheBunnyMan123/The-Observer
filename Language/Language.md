# Unnamed Non-linear Language
## Separators & such
These are the only things in this language that are definite and must not change. You do not have to use these, but they can make things easier.

| Symbol      | Meaning                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[Any Line] | Link ideas together. The more lines there are, the higher priority the grouping is |

## Basic ideas
These are not definite, as this language is entirely up to interpretation. These are just examples, but when I use this language I will use these as-is
